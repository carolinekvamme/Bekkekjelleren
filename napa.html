        <p>Napa Valley is a wine region in Napa County in the northern part of California,
          and houses over 400 wineries. Not only is the region famous for it's magnificent wines,
          it also is the home to many rare species. The county also has several Michelin-starred
          restaurants. Because of the county's location, the region has experienced
          some threathening fires. Especially the past few years have been threathened
          by fires.
        </p>
        <p>California is the biggest wine producing state in the US, making over 90 percent
          of the total wine production in the states. In fact, California produces
          such a large amount of wine that if the state was a country it would be the
          fourth leading wine-producing country in the world. The three leading countries
          are France, Italy and Spain. In October 2018, just prior to establishing Bekkekjeller’n, we spent
          a week in Napa Valley, USA, visiting some of our favorite wineries.

        <p>The Norwegian palate seems to enjoy the Napa wines, and we were
          therefore trying to find some typical Premium wines from this area.
          What we found was some really nice wines from Stag’s Leap Wine Cellar,
          a producer that is ranked among the world’s best Cabernet Sauvignon
          producers.We have FAY, S.L.V and Cask23 in stock, some even in Magnum
          (1,5 ltr) and Jeraboam (3 ltr) bottle size. We also had the pleasure
          of a private tour with a log of nice tasting at the Joseph Phelps
          Vineyards, a family-owned estate founded in 1973.
          The view when tasting is magnificent, and led us to bring home a
          nice selection of their wines. Napa Valley truly is one of the regions
          it is worth exploring if you are interested in wine, and we can't wait
          to next trip!
