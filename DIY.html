      <h2>DIY - making my own wine cellar</h2>
      <p>I was forced to do something about all the wines stored and stacked
        everywhere at home and in my cabin in the mountains. So hard to keep
        track of all the wines I had too, so I finally decided to build what I
        wanted myself.
      </p>
      <p>I googled and searched, I found producers that had different DIY-modules,
        very expensive, and not necessarily quite what I wanted either. I checked
        prices for planks in different qualities, and decided for oak which is
        solid, pretty and would give an exclusive background for my Premium Wines.
        I looked at many nice cellars online, I started drawing the modules and
        shelves I wanted and that would suit our needs, both for private wines
        and for tasting/sales via Bekkekjeller’n.
      </p>
      <p>A standard, small bedroom was sacrified. We decided to paint the walls
        in a nice grey tone, but it turned out darker then expected. In order to
        not have to do it all over, we decided to keep it, since all walls would
        be more or less covered with wines. I started with the corner shelves and
        the took both side walls with the shelves.

      <p>It really looked nice after a while! Wines were counted and arranged,
        systems were made, and house and cabin soon looked much tidier!
      </p>
      <p>Now we arrange tastings for interested buyers, events and parties.
        The modules and DIY-sets can be worked out in cooperation with interested
        buyers and self-builders. Even the smallest room can be used to store a
        lot of wine when planned in a smart way. Get in touch for more information
        about prices, materials and modules for YOUR new wine cellar!
