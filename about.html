          <p>Bekkekjeller’n started as a project made by the owner, Espen Hoel.
            He is originally an oil rig supervisor who started to love wine.
            Therefore, he started to visit wine farms in his holidays. This
            quickly escalated into Espen wanting to make his own wine cellar
            at his cabin, to store and preserve his exclusive wine collection.
            Espen had designed and built the cellar all by himself. The cellar
            also became the inspiration for his company named after his DIY
            project. In 2019, Bekkekjeller’n was established.
          </p>
          <p>Our goal is to provide our customers with the best wine. Our
            collection consists of wine from all around the world. Because we at
            Bekkekjeller’n strive after always improving and finding new wine,
            we regularly visit wine farms to gather information about the wines
            we offer, as well as we continuously expand our wine collection.
            Therefore, we can with certainty say that we offer excellent wine.
