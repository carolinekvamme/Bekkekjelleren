        <p>The magnificent wine region in France, from provence to the pyreness
          is the home wines such as Chardonney and Merlot.The Languedoc-Roussillon
          region is three times the combined area of the vineyards in Bordeaux,
          as big as 2,996 km2 of vineyeards, and the region has been an important
          winemaking centre for several centuries. Because the region is wide, the
          region produces many different varieties of grapes. The peak growing season
          is usually between May and August, and the annual temprature is around 14°C.
        </p>
        <p>Bekkekjeller’n exploited the area in July 2019. Starting with a visit
          to very south of France, close to the Spanish border, to the small town
          of Banyuls. Here we had a visit to Domaine de la Rectorie. A winemaker
          that makes wonderful, sweet dessert wines that we really liked! Rich,
          concentrated fruit with a long aftertaste.

        <p>Chateau Cap de Fouste was next on our list. This turned out to
          be a very pleasant winery with nice wines that we think will suit the
          Norwegian market well. Bekkekjeller’n now represents this winery with
          one red and one white. Chateau Valmy is situated outside of Collioure,
          a wine producer that successfully blends the excellence of its wines with
          the beauty of its vineyard. Some really premium wines were bought and
          brought home for the Norwegian market. Prierué Saint Jean de Bébian was
          last on our list. A wonderful producer that has been in business since
          the year 1152!! It was a heavy suitcase that was brought home with lots
          of nice wines, some of them even numbered.
